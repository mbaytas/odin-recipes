      <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to
        package instructions until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, whisk together eggs and both cheeses in a
        large bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook pancetta over medium heat until crispy, about
        5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add minced garlic to the skillet and cook for another minute until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pasta is done, reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain
        the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the hot pasta to the skillet with pancetta and garlic. Toss to
        combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from heat and quickly stir in the egg and cheese
        mixture, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. Add pasta water as
        needed to reach desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated cheese if desired.
